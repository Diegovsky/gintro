  Gobject Introspection bindings to Zig. This enables you to generate bindings to mapped libraries of GLib to Zig or other languages if you want. Examples include Gtk, Glib, GIO and much more!

# Contributing
  If you notice any problems in the library, spot some bug or just feel something could be changed, do open an issue or pull request! They are always welcome and I will be happy to review them :)
